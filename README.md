Themer
======

*Themer is a colorscheme generator and manager for your desktop.*


Installation
------------

### AUR (Arch)

Install [python-themer-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-themer-git/) with the AUR manager of your choice:

    $ yaourt -S python-themer-git


### PyPi

`themer` is now available in the PyPi repository as well. You can use a tool like `pip` to install it:

    $ pip install themer


### Manual Installation

First, check out the git repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/S0lll0s/themer.git

Install with `python setup.py install`

    $ cd themer
    $ sudo python setup.py install


Configuration
-------------

You can create multiple template dirs for `themer` in `~/.config/themer/templates`.
The default template is `i3`; see [data/default](data/default) for the default configuration.

Structure of Themer
-------------------

### The main directory

Everything Themer does happens in `.config/themer/`.

In a running setup this directory will contain the following:

- `templates`, a directory holding the templates for your all your
  themes. This is where new themes are generated from.
- as many themes (which are directories) as you want. These hold the
  config files that are specifically generated for this one
  theme. (They also contain a file called `colors.yaml`, where you can
  look up and change variables used in the theme.)
- `current`, a symbolic link to some of the themes.

For most people it only holds 1 directory (called `i3` by default) for
their setup.  If you like to switch your DE or the general appearance
of your window manager you might want to add more of them. If you are
only interested in small changes like colors and wallpapers (which
don't change the structure of your configs, only the details) you are
probably fine with one. (This is an abstraction layer which exists for
historical reasons and might be removed in the future).

### the templates

So how does a template look like? A useful template contains:

- One or more file-templates. They should (but don't have to) end with
  `.tpl` and contain your config. Variables should have the form `{{
  variable_name }}` and will be replaced by their value when themer
  renders them.
- A (potentially empty) directory of plugins. If plugins are placed
  here they can be activated by mentioning them in `config.yaml`
- `config.yaml`, which tells themer how to use the other files.

`config.yaml` has 3 sections:

- `variables`, where `primary: red` means hat the files listed below
  will be rendered with  `{{ primary }}` replaced by `red`
- `plugins`, divided  in `parsers` and `activators`, each  with a list
  of activated plugins.
- `files`, where `fromfile: tofile` means that `fromfile` (which is
  supposed to be the name of a file-template) is rendered to `tofile`
  in the rendered theme.

Usage
-----

### Integrating Themer with your Setup

All the following steps will show you how to use `themer` to generate
themes, but you also need to configure your DE to use the generated
theme.

`themer` does not assume anything about the tools you use in your DE,
you need to tell your DE about `themer`.  The current theme will
always be available in `$XDG_HOME/themer/current` (usually
`.config/themer/current`).  To use `themer`, symlink the seperate
files from there to their destination.

For example, this is how to set up `i3` with `themer`:

    $ mkdir -p .i3
    $ ln -s ~/.config/themer/current/i3.conf .i3/config


### Generating Themes

Generate a theme from a wallpaper:

    $ themer generate themename wallpaper.png

...or install a colorscheme from `sweyla.com`:
 
    $ themer generate themename 693812

(this will install [http://sweyla.com/themes/seed/693812/](http://sweyla.com/themes/seed/693812/))

you can also use an Xresources-style file:

    $ themer generate themename /home/me/.Xresources

[Plugins](#plugins) enable you to generate themes from other sources
as well, see below.


### Viewing Installed Themes

You can list all generated themes with `themer list`:

    $ themer list
    themeone
    themetwo


### Viewing Installed Plugins

    $ themer plugins
    Enabled activators:
      themer.activators.wallfix.WallfixActivator
      themer.activators.i3.I3Activator
    Enabled parsers:
      themer.parsers.SweylaColorParser
      themer.parsers.KmeansColorParser
      themer.parsers.CachedColorParser
      themer.ColorParser


### Activating Themes

You can activate an existing theme with `themer activate`:

    $ themer activate sometheme

This will symlink all defined templates to
`~/.config/themer/current`. You should, in turn, symlink all the
global configuration files to there. For example for i3:

    $ ln -s ~/.config/themer/current/i3.conf ~/.i3/config

To view the currently activated theme's colors use `themer current`.

If you have modified the templates or a themes `colors.yaml`,
activating the theme again will not apply those changes. Instead use
`themer render` to update your configuration:

    $ themer render sometheme

You can also re-render all of your themes (for example if you changed
a lot in your configuration) by supplying `all` instead of a theme's
name:

    $ themer render all


### Deleting Themes

Deleting generated themes is possible using `themer delete`:

    $ themer delete sometheme

Plugins
-------

Plugins can be installed anywhere into your PYTHONPATH, but the `plugins` directory under the used template dir is automatically added to `sys.path`, so you may want to place them there (usually this is `~/.config/themer/templates/i3/plugins`).
They are loaded via their python module-an-classname string; e.g. `mymodule.activator.MyActivator`.
Plugins are configured on a template-directory basis, in the `config.yaml` file (default `~/.config/themer/templates/i3/config.yaml`).

There are two kinds of plugins: **Activators** and **Parsers**.
Activators should inherit from `themer.ThemeActivator`, Parsers should inherit from `themer.ColorParser`.


### `ThemeActivator`s
Activators are run once every time a theme is activated. Use them to reload configuration files, set desktop wallpapers etc.

Each Activator should implement the method `activate`.
The constructor is passed the values for `theme_name`, `theme_dir` and `logger`.
All of these and `colors` can be accessed via the instance's properties.


#### Example:

    from themer import ThemeActivator
    import os
    
    class I3Activator(ThemeActivator):
        def activate(self):
            os.system('i3-msg -q restart')


### `ColorParser`s
Parsers are used to generate colorschemes from files and strings.

Each ColorParser should implement the method `read`, which should return the color dictionary generated from the input string in `self.data` (or obtained via the constructor's first argument).
A ColorParser can additionally return a path to a wallpaper to be used by setting `self.wallpaper` to anything other than `None`.

Additionally, Parsers need to have a `check` attribute. It is used to determine whether a Parser should be used for a given color source. `check` can either be a function, in which case it is passed the color-source string and expected to return a truthy value if it wants to handle that color source, or a string.
If it is a string it will be used as a regex and matched against the color source string.

The `themer.check_file_regex` helper can be used to build a `check` function that checks filenames against a regex and verifies their existence on the filesystem.

The constructor is passed the values for `data`, `config` and `logger`.
All of these can be accessed via the instance's properties.
The default constructor also sets `self.colors` to a new dictionary and `self.wallpaper` to `None`.


#### Example:

    from themer import ColorParser, check_file_regex

    class NewColorParser(ColorParser):
        check = check_file_regex('\.yaml$')
        def read(self):
            with open(self.data) as fh: # load colors from a yaml file
                self.colors = yaml.load(fh)
            return self.colors
